# Weather-Forecast-static-Webpage

This project is a simple webpage designed to display weather forecast information. The webpage features a clean and user-friendly interface with the following components:

1. **Heading:**
   - A prominent heading "Weather Forecast" at the top of the page indicates the purpose of the webpage.

2. **Input Box with Submit Button:**
   - Below the heading, users can find an input box where they can enter a location or query related to weather.
   - Adjacent to the input box, there's a submit button for users to submit their queries.

3. **Four Tables:**
   - Following the input section, the webpage presents four tables displaying different aspects of the weather forecast.
   - Each table likely includes relevant weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, organized in rows and columns.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of building a static webpage to showcase weather forecast information. It aims to provide users with a straightforward interface to access weather data for their desired location.
